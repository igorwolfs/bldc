# Orientation Indications
## Capacitors
The orientation of polar capacitor cathodes are indicated with a + sign.
This is done for the following capacitors
- C106666 (x3) (470 uF capacitor)
- C568913 (x6), (100 uF capacitor)
## Diodes
The orientation of diode polarity is a cathode indication with a dot.
This is done for the diodes:
- C191023 (x5) (1N5819WS)
- C7496820 (x2) (F.0603.00139/P2-0603R1TS2-06T-002)
- C7496819 (x1) (F.0603.00026/P2-0603B1TS2-06T-001)

## MOSFET's
The gate positioning of the 6 mosfets (IRFZ44NPBF) are indicated by a capital "G" on the back silk-screen of the board next to the relevant hole.

## IC packages
IC package and connector orientation have their first pin indicated using an arrow-like silkscreen indicator.
