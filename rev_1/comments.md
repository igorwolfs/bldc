# Orientation Indications
## Capacitors
The orientation of polar capacitor cathodes are indicated with a + sign.
This is done for the following capacitors
- C106666 (x3) (470 uF capacitor)
- C568913 (x6), (100 uF capacitor)
## Diodes
The orientation of diode polarity is a cathode indication with a dot.
This is done for the diodes:
- C191023 (x5) (1N5819WS)
- C7496820 (x2) (F.0603.00139/P2-0603R1TS2-06T-002)
- C7496819 (x1) (F.0603.00026/P2-0603B1TS2-06T-001)

## MOSFETS
The gate positioning of the 6 mosfets (IRFZ44NPBF) are indicated by a capital "G" on the back silk-screen of the board next to the relevant drillhole.

## IC packages
IC package and connector orientation have their first pin indicated using an arrow-like silkscreen indicator.

# Tooling Holes, Fiducial Markers, Testpoints and pads.
The following items were removed from the BOM, since they do not require any assembly from jlcpcb.

## Tooling holes
Tooling holes, indicated by the "H" reference indicator, have a hole diameter of 1.152 mm as recommended by jlcpcb.

## Fiducial Markers
Fiducial markers, indicated by the "FM" reference indicator, have a diameter of 1 mm as recommended by jlcpcb.

## Testpoints
Testpoints indicated by the reference indicator "TP" are plated holes meant for testing the PCB on arrival by the customer (me). They should have NO soldermask on the back, they may have soldermask on the front.

## Pads
Pads indicated by the reference "P" are meant for soldering high current wires on arrival by the customer (me). These pads should have NO soldermask on them to make manual soldering easy.
