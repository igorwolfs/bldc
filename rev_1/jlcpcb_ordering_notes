# Component choice
- Place components only on one side (25 dollars) instead of 2-sides for cheaper assembly assembly.
- Use standard components, that are in the feeder by default. In no-standard (extended) component case the price to load a component into the feeder is 3 dollars.
- Make sure to buy as much of the same components as possible.

# Size of board
- Order 100x100mm board (or whatever is the largest size that can be bought without increasing the price too much).
- Leave enough space for manual assembly if necessary, create clear silkscreen indications where possible.
- Make sure to respect the minimum hole diameter.
